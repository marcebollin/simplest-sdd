# Simplest SDD Schema Changelog

This changelog tracks the installed simplest-sdd schema, not the npm package version. The npm package can release CLI or packaging fixes without changing the schema version.

## 1.0.0 - 2026-06-17

- Added a skill-local schema marker in `.agents/skills/spec-library/SKILL.md`.
- Made `AGENTS.md` the canonical instruction source for all agents.
- Switched Claude compatibility from a `CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md` symlink to a regular `CLAUDE.md` file that imports `@AGENTS.md`.
- Kept `.agents/skills/spec-library` as the canonical skill and `.claude/skills/spec-library` as the Claude compatibility symlink.
- Switched generated specs, plans, decisions, indexes, and templates to clean static HTML.
- Documented readable embedded CSS, visible focus styles, and optional simple chart guidance in the generated skill.
- Added npx-ready `init`, `update`, and `remove` agent-instruction prompts.

### Migration from unversioned installs

1. Inspect existing `AGENTS.md`, `CLAUDE.md`, `.agents/skills/spec-library`, and `.claude/skills/spec-library`.
2. Preserve unique `CLAUDE.md` instructions by merging them into `AGENTS.md`.
3. Replace any `CLAUDE.md -> AGENTS.md` symlink with a regular `CLAUDE.md` file containing `@AGENTS.md`.
4. Add `<!-- simplest-sdd-schema-version: 1.0.0 -->` to `.agents/skills/spec-library/SKILL.md` immediately after the frontmatter.
5. Keep the skill symlink at `.claude/skills/spec-library -> ../../.agents/skills/spec-library`.
6. Convert generated Markdown templates, indexes, specs, plans, and decisions to clean static HTML when conversion is safe.
7. Preserve old Markdown artifacts whenever ownership or conversion fidelity is unclear.
